A "feed reader" for the gopher space.

In today's web (2011), programs called "feed readers" are ubiquitous.
They regularly retrieve a special resource (the "feed") which represents
a web page's content in a simplified and standardized format. A feed
reader also checks if that feed contains new items and notifies you
about that.

gophcatch is a feed reader's equivalent for gopher. It retrieves a
gopher menu and checks if it contains new items. This allows you to keep
up with another user's phlog, for example.


Installation
------------

gophcatch is a Bash script and relies on the following external tools:

    - curl
    - lynx

You will also need a cron-like program.

If you're on Arch Linux, you can use the following AUR package:

    - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gophcatch-git/


Running
-------

gophcatch is not meant to be run interactively. Instead, configure your
~/.gocrc and add a cronjob. Refer to the manpage for further details.
